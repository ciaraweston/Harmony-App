An application that gives users the ability to donate food to community fridges to help fight food insecurity in Philadelphia. Users are able to volunteer and set their own schedules on how they can help Harmony's Fridge. Whether it's cleaning the fridge, donating, spreading awareness and monitoring the inventory.
This application is also available for users who are in need of food. The user is able to see the items available, the quantity and location of which these community fridges are located and they're able to take whatever they need for free.
